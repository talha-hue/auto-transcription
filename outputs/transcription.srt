1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All right. Yeah, happy to hear about yourself and your role at UNI lever and then we can start with the questions.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, so in some enterprise architect that you leave up, I partner with our technology services area, which basically means that my main focus is on infrastructure and cloud.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And cloud and that kind of thing.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, as an enterprise architect, I produce quite a lot of documentation and artifact for various stakeholders.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, it can be, you know, PowerPoint or senior stakeholders, it can be write down to very in depth technical documents for our technical teams.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, I thought if you want me to carry on as to where the easy generator comes in at the moment or whether you want to get on to that later.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, I guess once we go into the questions that will inevitably come up. So yeah, all right. Perfect. So, I'll go ahead and get started with the first question.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, the first question is around your initial impressions about the doctor course functionality.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, what were your initial impressions when you heard about the doctor course functionality for the first time and what specific problem did you hope it would solve?

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, as a follow up to that, then were you expecting a draft course that I can use to create a course with be a course ready for publication or see something in the middle?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's difficult because I've not created a course before. I've only ever created the document artifacts.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So, the AI element to it and the easy generation part of it. I didn't really have any expectations because I'm feeling my way through just creating a course in the first place. That makes sense.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right. Okay. So, at that time, you don't have any initial expectations.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right. I guess. Yeah. No worries. All right. Then moving to the next one, which is then more on the usage side of things.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, when you were using the doctor course functionality, what was the first thing you noticed? Did anything surprise you at that time?

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, so I first learned about it on the onboarding session, which was provided by the company.

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I had enrolled some weeks and weeks ago, but I didn't find the information sufficient to use the tool.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, the onboarding, I took a course on the onboarding, took me through how to do the course generation.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And it was only at that time that I found out about the document element to it. So, I expected to have some kind of AI assistant maybe, but I didn't expect to just give it a document and off it goes.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So, I found out about that on the onboarding. So, I would say the onboarding is invaluable to get people to actually use the tool. It really, really helps.

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But yeah, I didn't even know about the document element until then. So, I would say, yeah, I was, I'm really impressed generally with the fact that you can feed it in a document and an out pops course. Yeah, for sure.

22
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Absolutely. Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All right. So, the next question then on the usage side of things as well, which is a follow up to that. Could you walk me through how you use a doctor course feature and can you think out loud while doing it?

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Tell me what you think at every step. No right or wrong answers here. Just be as candid as you can be.

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, just step by step how you use the functionality and you can think out loud while doing it.

26
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well, I mean, I would say it quite gingerly in that I've not done it before. So, I'm kind of feeling my way around wasn't quite sure what the steps were to take.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I managed to get through it. It asked me all the questions up front. So, it feels very much like that's crucial part is to answer all of those questions with as much detail as possible.

28
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then once you put that initial effort in, I think the actual creation was quite simple.

29
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the only thing that I guess could have been easier or could have been even more of a time safer was it didn't seem to take the images from my documents.

30
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, I recall I had to then go through and replace into the images. And I guess that could be a little bit smoother even if it doesn't know which image to use in which section.

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Perhaps it could take the images in. Put them in a kind of holding area. So, you could literally just click and say, you know, put image on here, image to there. Right. That was the only laborious thing that I seem to remember was doing the images.

32
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's perfect. And I think we are actually working towards that functionality to bring over the images. That's something on our roadmap already and we're working towards it. So you will be having that soon in the doctor's functionality.

33
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, thanks for sharing that. Appreciate it. Perfect. Okay. So question number four then moves on to on so on the uses side, but then a little bit more about the documents. So, if you could tell us about the documents you've uploaded to use this feature.

34
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How helpful was this option? And as a follow up to that, what documents did you upload or sorry what type of documents is your upload and were there any formats you wish were supported but weren't.

35
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, yeah, amazingly useful. So, I created two courses so far.

36
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The topic, I mean, the topic is platform engineering, right? So, it's a technical topic. It may not be an in fact, it isn't a topic that many people are very familiar with.

37
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So, what I've created is two separate courses. I've created a beginner's course, which is purely vanilla in that I did not load any documents for that one. I just said, you know, generally, if I'm somebody that doesn't know this topic, give me an understanding of the topic.

38
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, that seemed to be appropriate in terms of the level for beginners. So, that was the first one. So, then the second one is the either for people that are already familiar with the topic or they've taken the first course, then they can move on to the second course.

39
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And what the second course is, is I've called it intermediate, but this is harnessing platform engineering within Unilever.

40
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, this is far more detailed and it's not just a vanilla, what is it? It talks about how you can apply it and gives examples and it's quite a technical document in nature.

41
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It happens to be a word document. It's what we call a point of view in Unilever. We produce all sorts of different documents.

42
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This one, as it suggests, is a point of view. It's as an enterprise architect. How do I think we could benefit from platform engineering within Unilever?

43
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, it's word, it's about 20-odd pages long and it's got, I'd say, 20 plus images that are all Unilever-specific images.

44
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So, hence, that makes it, the content is far more tailored than to our company and would probably get a different audience to the basic one.

45
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, that's the only format I've tried. Possibly, so we do also create a PowerPoint kind of deck for leadership, you know, executive.

46
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's so, it's mainly just the images, a subset of the document with images, not so much on the text, very, very little text on each one.

47
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But yeah, that would be a PowerPoint, and I don't know if that's something that you support already.

48
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, well then, Dr. Cours, we have the PowerPoint supported as well as Word and PDF.

49
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay, cool. That's very nice to know. And thanks so much for providing the hills around the document. That's super helpful.

50
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And will definitely help us make this functionality better.

51
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, so then moving on to then the generated bit with regards to the content accuracy and relevancy.

52
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So, the question is how accurate was the content generated from your uploaded documents? If you could rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the accuracy of content.

53
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then as a follow up to that, what aspects of the content were most or least accurate?

54
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay, so that one is a little bit tricky at the moment, although I'd be happy to offer a follow up call because it's out for review at the moment.

55
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I sent it out to my team for feedback. And then I've also asked for a small focus group to come together because this is the first time we're doing it.

56
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I want to ask those questions of my users before we look to perhaps expand it and roll it out for all the topics.

57
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So for me, I had a quick look through, but it's really hard to check your own homework, right? You know, I wrote the documents.

58
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So I did go through it myself. I took the quizzes test. Thankfully, I did get them all right.

59
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If that could have been a problem. So obviously the content was it made sense from that point of view.

60
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And it was able to pull out relevant sensible questions.

61
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if I was to give it a score, I would say four at the moment. But I don't know, you know, it could go either way depending on what the users say.

62
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, absolutely. And we can definitely set up a follow up call or even coordinate on email and see you've received any updates and you can share that with that.

63
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Fantastic. Well, thanks. Appreciate sharing that information.

64
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So then with regards to the content again, how well did it align with the course goal and objectives?

65
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So as a follow up that also could you give me an example of a goal or an objective that was well aligned and also something that was not well aligned if there was anything.

66
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Again, I'm probably just going to say, you know, a four at the moment and wait to see if we need to tweak that when we get the feedback.

67
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All right, perfect.

68
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All right. So I'm just looking at the next question is also around the output.

69
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But then this is more about the different elements within the output. So how effective was the overall output when compared to what you may have created manually.

70
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Right. So if you could rate each of the following elements on a scale of one to five and briefly explain any any areas where output for each element exceeded or fell short of your expectations.

71
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So the elements are course structure learning objectives page content questions and images.

72
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So we're here comparing what you would have created manually versus what was auto generated and then yeah, if these elements.

73
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So I think I'm going to go for a four for all of them except for the images which have I explained earlier. I'll probably give that a two.

74
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay. Okay. And were there any areas where they exceeded or fell short of your expectations. So the structure, the objectives, questions.

75
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I think it I think generally the fours because it all up to this point up to the course generation points. It's all exceeded what I initially expected.

76
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The stage in it now, which I think I put in the briefing is I don't know if we get on to that on the questions, but it's once you've generated the course then what and there's a lot of obstacles and unknowns and that kind of thing which

77
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you know, maybe as I say the onboarding was really valuable.

78
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I think had it not been for that I probably wouldn't have had the nudge to use it to be fair.

79
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So maybe there's there's something around, you know, taking you through after you've created it.

80
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I've done the publishing which you know download some.

81
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Or I don't even know what they are right because I've not done courses before so this now is obstacles and it's proven to be a bit tricky now within you.

82
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So maybe that's some handholding that you guys could offer going forward.

83
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But I know that's probably skipping questions.

84
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But no, in terms of the generation, I say all of all because I'd say it was all of all the expectations to be fair.

85
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I was surprised and you know, that like I say the I mean, if you want an example, the quizzes in particular, I just thought was right, you know, because

86
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
they all made sense and like I say I got them, I got them right.

87
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So they must have made sense. So that was good.

88
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Perfect. Awesome.

89
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And then moving on to the structuring of topics and the course layout.

90
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So if you went into the course and checked out the layout on how it was basically structure.

91
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So did you find the structure of topics and course, they are suggested by the course, but they're helpful via why not.

92
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And what changes would you make to the layout if there are any.

93
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So it wasn't what I expected.

94
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Or let me be afraid that I wouldn't suggest any changes.

95
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because the new to course generation, I think, you know, I'm being led by people that have created a lot of courses in the past and have come up with an optimal solution.

96
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So I'm assuming that the structure we've got is optimal for some reason, right.

97
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But given that it was like a say a 20-odd page document, I think it broke it down just into three or four sections, which felt very light to me.

98
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That was the only feedback for that kind of document.

99
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think for the introduction one that I did, the vanilla one, it was five.

100
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But for the document creation one where you've got a heavy technical document, I was expecting more sections.

101
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because I felt like they didn't quite marry up to the whole document.

102
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I wouldn't suggest changing it.

103
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because like I say, you know, I'm sure that, you know, if you if you put too many sections in, people may not take the course.

104
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It might be too long to complicate it, etc. So, you know, I wouldn't necessarily say that change the changing it was just an observation on my side.

105
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Got it. That's super helpful.

106
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then just follow up to that in terms of the technical document that you mentioned about 20 pages.

107
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:28,000
When you create courses on these documents, is it that you kind of replicate the information that's there is essential that everything comes as is or rephrasing it or restructuring it.

108
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Can make sense.

109
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, there's a question.

110
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I've never created a course on it before.

111
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I've said, so we are very well versed in creating documents.

112
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And so the trigger on the main trigger to the course is reaching a broader audience.

113
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So finding another channel because we all learn differently, right?

114
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So a detailed technical documents is find for technical teams.

115
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And even then they probably, you know, not all of them will read it all.

116
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But you want to be able to reach, you know, perhaps for management grades, higher level grades that are just not going to.

117
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Read to that level of detail.

118
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So I think I think it's fine with which we're trying this out.

119
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I think for the objective for us, which is to reach more people with the message in a different format, I think it's fine.

120
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Perfect.

121
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I wouldn't expect the whole contents of the documents being included in the course.

122
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, definitely not because also I've tried to play around with, you know, the test function.

123
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I've set a plane around with like a 70% pass level for the basic one and a 90% pass level for the more advanced one.

124
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And I think if you put too much information in, you know, how are people going to get that 70% or do you have to drop?

125
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Right down. So I don't think there's an issue with it.

126
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Got it, got it.

127
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Fantastic. Thanks for sharing that.

128
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So then there's, we have three more questions left.

129
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So how would you describe your overall experience using Doctor Course feature on a scale of one to five?

130
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How would you rate your overall experience? And then what were the highlights and low points of your experience?

131
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So I would go for overall very impressed.

132
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
High points were, I'd say the questions all seemed relevant.

133
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The content at all seemed sensible.

134
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The points is the images replacing all of those was a little bit laborious.

135
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And the host publishing functions now.

136
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You know, I think it does assume that perhaps you're a learning professional using this.

137
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And that you used to publish in courses or creating courses.

138
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And I didn't have a format. It didn't mean anything to me.

139
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So it presented me with three options.

140
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Skull.

141
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Version 1.2, version three and API.

142
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't know. I don't know the difference. So I was at a standpoint there.

143
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I didn't know what to do. So I reached out internally then to our, you know, learning team.

144
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What do I do now? I've created this, but now where do I go?

145
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Maybe something on your end to put little explainers in about what these formats are.

146
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You know, where you go next. So, you know, are they only for learning management systems like so we use cornerstone, for example.

147
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
My objective is to surface this through degree to your word of degree.

148
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I don't think it needs to be this special format for degree.

149
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So I guess it. Yeah, what's the follow on then?

150
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Once you've got this file, what can you do with it? What's some common examples?

151
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And where could you go for more help? Having said that, I do know that in the screen and the easy generator screen, you've always got the little button on the bottom right, which says, you know,

152
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
you want some help click this foot. So I know I can go there. And in fact, I did. I asked some questions there.

153
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But it'd be nice. You know, you don't want to be just keeping on going to that and asking those questions. So it just be nice if there was a little bit more information there about what you do next.

154
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It just seems to stop. Right. You've got your score on file. That's it. Stop.

155
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Absolutely. Thanks for sharing that. I think that's really, really important feedback. And because we strive to make our tool as easy as possible for subgeumar experts and as intuitive as possible.

156
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So this feedback, I'll forward to our course publication team and we'll ensure that try to make that as simple as possible and make it easy to understand for subgeumar experts that are not necessarily learning development professionals.

157
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So thank you for sharing that. It's super important. No, okay. Then second last question. So if you could change one thing about doctor's feature, what would it be and what feature with significantly enhanced your experience?

158
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So yeah, the images, I think would be the main thing. So either have it go, what bringing the images in or like I say, just put them in, you know, some kind of media manager, let's say.

159
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So then you can just literally click and choose click and choose rather than, you know, just make that a bit quicker. That was all.

160
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
All right. Perfect. Right. And then lastly, is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with the doctor's feature that we haven't covered or any other comments or suggestions that you may have?

161
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Only to repeat what I said earlier, really, I think the fact that you do reach out proactively.

162
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And you know, you dedicate somebody to literally sit through and show someone how to use the tool.

163
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I think that's a huge value. And I think from your point of view, you know, that really does bring value back to you because, you know, I had, you know, I had the idea I had some enthusiasm to go and do this without that onboarding.

164
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sure I would have done it because it all felt a bit, you know, especially not being alone in professional right. It all felt just a little bit difficult.

165
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And yeah, when I get time, I'll sit down and I'll learn about it. But having that onboarding session.

166
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That really, really made a difference. And usually I wouldn't take a call.

167
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Like I've taken from yourself today, you know, obviously as an EA, we get loads of vendors all the time trying to get time in the diary, but because it's clearly your esophage to work that way.

168
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And the experience that I've had so far, hence that's why I was happy to do the call and give you the feedback. So I think this proactiveness that you do in, yeah, it's amazing.

169
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So that's what I would add. Yeah.

170
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Thank you so much. And this is a really great feedback. And I'll force forward this to our onboarding team that they've done a great job.

171
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So really, really appreciate you sharing that and of course we'll continue to be as practical as possible and try to educate all of our users on the new features that are coming and to help them utilize the tool and much better.

172
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That's fantastic. All right. So that wraps up our interview. Thank you so much, Janice, for your time.

173
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
All I would say is obviously for me, I still haven't got a published course, right?

174
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I'm assuming that going forward, I'm going to get what I need from our learning team and the lady I've been dealing with is helpful, but she just doesn't know.

175
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
She's kind of trying to find a way through it with me and I've logged a call with our training team.

176
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So that's the only potential risk. If that doesn't go right, I won't be doing any more.

177
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But if that goes right, I'll be potentially rolling this out to many other topics. So I don't know whether you have got any influence there or if you've got any, you know, partnerships in the back end with our learning team or.

178
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't know, but that's just that's a risk is that if that side of it, which is beyond your control right now, doesn't go well, then you might lose me, but if it goes and you'll see some more courses popping up hopefully.

179
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Absolutely. And I hope it goes well. And then also once you have that feedback on that course that you've created.

180
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Let me know on what the feedback was from the.

181
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay. How do I do that? How did I let you know what's the best way?

182
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah, on my email address would be.

183
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The email. Okay.

184
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, I can send it over right now here. This is very quickly.

185
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Here we are. Yeah, just on my email. And if it's really extensive, we can also connect over call.

186
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But yeah, I think that will be great.

187
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because then we can take that into account. So if it's if it's fall short in some areas, we can take that into account and then try to improve.

188
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If it's fantastic, then of course we can consider keeping certain elements the same.

189
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So that's we're collecting feedback from all the different users and then we'll see where are the key themes around them and make decisions based on that.

190
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
All right. Thank you. Thank you, Janice. Have a nice day.

191
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Bye bye. Bye bye.
